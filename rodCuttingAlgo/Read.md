# Rod Cutting Problem

Given a rod of length `n` inches and an array `price[]`, where `price[i]` denotes the value of a piece of length `i`, your task is to determine the **maximum value obtainable** by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces.

> **Note:**  
> - `n = size of price`  
> - `price[]` is a **1-indexed** array (i.e., `price[1]` gives price of length-1 piece)
